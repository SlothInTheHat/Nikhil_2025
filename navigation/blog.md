# What I've done so far


## Week 1

There was a lot of learning this week. I set up my page and downloaded all the tools. I also made a bash script to show tool versions and start the venv so I don't have to run each command individually.

Had to create a Github access key to push to my own repo.
-   did this 3 times because I kept changing my repo name
    git remote add origin https://<TOKEN>@github.com/<REPO-OWNER-USERNAME>/<REPO-NAME>

### lots of terminal stuff:
- Learned about giving execute permissions with chmod
- Renaming files and moving them around

## Week 2-3

### Custom theme for my site
I modified the default minima leaf theme to have different colors that I liked. It's still a bit dark for my liking so I might change that.

### First time using HTML
Made a program to fly text across the screen with motivational quotes. I added a user input field to add to the quote list. 
- Lots of ChatGPT and Stack Overflow involved. 
- still not entirely confident with HTML.
 
## Notes
- use java 17

## Week 4

### Animated images on about page

### Car game
still needs improvement ie textures and stuff


### Cookie Clicker Pair Project
added an upgrade button
