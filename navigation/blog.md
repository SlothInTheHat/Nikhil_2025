# What I've done so far


## Week 1

There was a lot of learning this week. I set up my page and downloaded all the tools. I also made a bash script to show tool versions and start the venv so I don't have to run each command individually.

### lots of terminal stuff:
- Learned about giving execute permissions with chmod
- Renaming files and moving them around
