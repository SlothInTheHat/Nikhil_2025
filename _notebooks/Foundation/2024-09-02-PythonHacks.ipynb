       "After what can at best be described as a somewhat disjointed third season thus far, the fifth episode of ‚ÄúThe Mandalorian‚Äù began to bring those pieces together and into focus, while continuing to draw upon the ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù animated series that preceded it, including another cameo by a character from the rightfully lauded ‚ÄúRebels.‚Äù\n",
       "\n",
       "Subtitled ‚ÄúThe Pirate,‚Äù the episode presented further evidence of the dysfunctional nature of the New Republic, unable or unwilling to defend a faraway planet from an invading band of pirates. (Lucasfilm being a unit of Disney, the marauders had a certain ‚ÄúYo ho, yo ho‚Äù vibe to them.)\n",
       "\n",
       "The siege also played into Mandalorian politics, and the efforts of Bo-Katan (Katee Sackhoff) to reclaim her heritage and potentially reunite her people‚Äôs various tribes, after leading them, along with Din Djarin (voiced by Pedro Pascal), to the rescue of his pal Greef Karga (Carl Weathers) and the planet‚Äôs residents.\n",
       "\n",
       "Still, the most pleasing moment for longtime ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù fans was likely what amounted to a throwaway scene, introducing a live-action version of the hulking alien Zeb, a character from the animated ‚ÄúStar Wars Rebels,‚Äù which concluded in 2018. ‚ÄúThe Mandalorian‚Äù has drawn heavily from those properties, which were overseen by one of its executive producers, Dave Filoni. (In another nice touch, Steve Blum again provided the voice of the character, and Zeb looked a whole lot better than the pirate leader.)\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, the episode closed with evidence that the evil Moff Gideon (played by Giancarlo Esposito previously) had seemingly been freed from the prison ship that was transporting him to stand trial, reviving that potential threat.\n",
       "\n",
       "Having resolved the fate of Grogu, a.k.a. Baby Yoda, during the first two seasons, ‚ÄúThe Mandalorian‚Äù has thus moved on to fill in narrative gaps about an under-explored chapter in ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù history ‚Äì namely, the factors that resulted in the fall of the New Republic and the rise of the First Order, the plot line featured in the most recent trilogy that began with ‚ÄúThe Force Awakens.‚Äù\n",
       "\n",
       "‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a rebellion anymore,‚Äù a bureaucrat (played by Tim Meadows) says about what happens outside of the New Republic‚Äôs jurisdiction, conveying an indifference to the fate of the planet Nevarro overtly articulated later when it was observed that the governing body in Coruscant ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt care.‚Äù\n",
       "\n",
       "Executive producers Jon Favreau and Filoni have taken their time in reaching this point, juggling these various issues in somewhat ungainly fashion through the first half of the season. That perhaps reflects the transition of the show to an emphasis on the macro instead of the micro, while still finding time to detour for the occasional ‚ÄúRebels‚Äù yell."

       "I was 12 in June of 1993 and vividly remember watching with glee when the Tyrannosaurus Rex, with its teeny arms and perpetual scowl, blew the walls of the bathroom down like a big bad wolf and promptly ate the lawyer character (played to hilarious effect by Martin Ferrero). Part of this, surely, had to do with the fact that I was a mouthy pre-teen, and many adults in my sphere at the time opined that I ‚Äúwould make a great lawyer‚Äù just like my father ‚Äì a fate I abhorred.\n",

       "Part of that lasting impact, of course, has to do with the still-groundbreaking effects in the movie, which surprisingly hold up, and on a fairly hi-tech 72-inch TV screen to boot. While the first dino money shot ‚Äì of the plant-eating brachiosaurus ‚Äì might look just a tad soupy in 2023, it still looks considerably better than more contemporary fare, and the ensuing imagery of the more predatory beasts (like T-rex and especially those raptors) remains top-notch. The computer-generated imagery in the movie is essentially credited with marking the end of stop-motion animation as the go-to effects option for films such as these, notably used in everything that came before, from 1933‚Äôs ‚ÄúKing Kong‚Äù to 1981‚Äôs ‚ÄúClash of the Titans.‚Äù The animatronics are something to behold as well, particularly the ailing triceratops responsible for that ‚Äúone big pile of s‚Äî,‚Äù one of many priceless quips uttered by Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum).\n",
       "\n",
       "The appeal of ‚ÄúJurassic,‚Äù based on Michael Crichton‚Äôs acclaimed novel, is also largely due to the film‚Äôs suspenseful and pared-down pacing, which of course can be linked to Spielberg, who learned a thing or two about keeping his cards close to his chest with ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù ‚Äì the great white mother of all creature features that famously showed startlingly little of the big fish before the climax.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù connection is prolific film composer John Williams, the Spielberg collaborator who created a majestic score for ‚ÄúJurassic Park‚Äù that is still synonymous with an air of discovery, one that can easily be hummed when looking upon any great view or upon entering a new and uncharted space.\n",

Aside from the always-dependable Goldblum, there‚Äôs Laura Dern, who carved out her own Sigourney Weaver-shaped notch in the movie thanks to that one terrifying sequence in the control shed. Plus, her reaction shot to that first dinosaur reveal ‚Äì along with that of Sam Neill ‚Äì could be viewed as a textbook for green-screen acting, which has become the standard ever since, in Marvel movies and beyond. Add to that the amazing and meme-worthy smaller performances from Samuel L. Jackson (‚ÄúHold onto your butts!‚Äù), Wayne Knight (‚ÄúAh ah ah! You didn‚Äôt say the magic word!‚Äù) and Bob Peck (‚ÄúClever girl‚Äù), and you‚Äôve got a crowd-pleaser that is equal parts adventure, comedy and chomp-chomp thriller.\n",

       "While the rest of the entries in the ‚ÄúJurassic‚Äù franchise have not exactly been up to par (aside from 2015‚Äôs not-terrible first reboot ‚ÄúJurassic World‚Äù), the original flick still ‚Äúrules‚Äù ‚Äì and is definitely worth a rewatch on the occasion of its 30th birthday."

       "The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.\n",
       "Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal, and reptile species.\n",
       "As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world."

       "JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).\n",
       "The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.\n",
       "Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design."
